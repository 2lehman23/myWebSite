<p>There are many people that I consider a hero, but I consider Robert Downey Jr. my hero.
 Robert Downey Jr. was born on april 4 1965 in New York, New York.He is the youngest of two children. Both of his parents were actors so his career was highly influenced by them. 
He started his acting career on brodway and then made his way into his television in 1985 when he was cast for Saturday Night Live. After this his career in movies began. 
He was in many movies before in 2008 he stared as Iron Man in the first Iron Man movie. After this he became a well known actor for the many Iron man movies and also for being one of the avengers.
<p>Robert Downey Jr. has been my hero since I was little. Every little kid Idolises one of the super heros they see on tv and for me that super hero was Iron man.
 I wanted to mess around with technology and make cool super hero things. Because of this I started playing with arduinos and tried to create things although the most I created was a led that lit up. 
 I recently was reminded of this childhood hero when I got a concussion. All I could do was watch tv. This lead me to re watch all of the Iron man movies and the Avengers ones too. 
 Overall, he has been an influence on my life and has changed the way I see the world.
